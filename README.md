This is a simple Windows application that converts images to Minecraft maps using the latest colors. It works for both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.

## How to Use

### <img src="ImageMap4/Icons/world.png" width=16> Worlds Tab

Here you can see a list of your Java and Bedrock worlds. Click on any one to open it. By default, the program looks in these folders:
* `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves`
* `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds`

If you have worlds saved elsewhere, such as on a server or in Education Edition, you can click the buttons to change where to look.

You can also drag and drop a world folder directly onto the program to open it, no matter where it is.

**In World**

On the right, you'll see maps that are already in your world, if any. Click on maps to select them.

For getting those maps on a wall easily, click "Generate Structure." Your selected maps will be arranged in a grid, and a structure block will be added to your inventory. Place it and load the structure to get your maps!

You can also delete maps or change their ID. Don't worry, everything can be undone with <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>.

**Importing**

On the left, you can import images to convert into maps.

All Minecraft maps must be 128x128 pixels, and Java Edition has a limited color palette, so there are a few options to control how your image should be modified.

You can split it into multiple maps, change the scaling mode, and choose the color distance and dithering algorithms. See which one you like best.

When you're ready, click "Send All to World" to transfer your maps to the world. If "Create structures" is checked, you'll automatically get a structure block in your inventory that can be used to place the maps on a wall.

### Version Palettes

For Java Edition, the program detects the version of your world to determine which colors are available. Here are all the supported palettes:
